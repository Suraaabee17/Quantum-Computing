Abstract

Our project embarks on a groundbreaking method of teaching quantum computing by integrating it with the excitement of augmented reality (AR) escape rooms. Picture yourself entering an AR environment where unraveling the intricacies of quantum circuits and gates is the key to your escape. In Level I, you'll grasp the foundational concepts, mastering the basics of quantum circuits and gates.

As you progress to Level II, the difficulty intensifies. You're not merely a student anymore; you're an innovator, employing your understanding to construct quantum logic gates and oracles. Each puzzle within our AR escape room is meticulously crafted to reinforce these principles, turning learning into an exhilarating adventure.

Our vision is to revolutionize the often daunting field of quantum computing into an accessible and captivating journey. By harnessing the immersive capabilities of AR and the educational potential of QiskitBlocks, we aim to demystify complex theories, making them not only comprehensible but genuinely enjoyable to delve into.

Ultimately, our goal is to create an interactive quantum universe where learning is an engaging experience from start to finish.

# Timeline

- [x] **Refining the Idea:** We've decided to create an escape room set in a Minecraft-like environment to teach Quantum Computing concepts using Minetest and QiskitBlocks.

- [x] **Literature Review:** Research existing projects similar to ours, specifically quantum escape rooms or the utilization of QiskitBlocks. Gather insights and ideas from these projects to improve our own.

- [x] **Gaming Environment Development:** Develop the gaming environment, predominantly coding in Python.

- [x] **Ideating Quantum Concepts:** Identify key quantum computing concepts to teach in the game. Develop creative ways to incorporate these concepts into the escape room environment. Some concepts we wish to include: Superposition, Entanglement, Quantum Gates (e.g., Hadamard, CNOT), Quantum Circuits.

- [x] **Incorporating these Concepts:** Design puzzles and challenges within the escape room that require players to understand and apply quantum concepts to progress.

- [x] **Integration of Literature Review Insights:** Incorporate any innovative ideas or elements discovered during the literature review into our game environment to enhance gameplay and educational value.

- [x] **Making Changes to the Gaming Environment:** Make necessary adjustments and refinements to the gaming environment based on our ideation, feedback and testing.

- [ ] **Publishing the Game on GitHub:** Prepare the game for publication on GitHub by adding ReadMe files, Requirements files, and any other necessary documentation.

- [ ] **Finishing Touches:** Polish the game with finishing touches to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience for players.

- [ ] **Publication:** Publish the game on GitHub as our project, making it accessible to the public for enjoyment and education.
